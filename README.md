# Moonlight Web
An unofficial [Moonlight Client](https://moonlight-stream.org/) allowing you to stream your pc to the Web.
It hosts Web Server which will forward [Sunshine](https://docs.lizardbyte.dev/projects/sunshine/latest/) traffic to a Browser using the [WebRTC Api](https://webrtc.org/).

## Limitations
- Features that only work in a [Secure Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts#:~:text=They%20must%20be,be%20considered%20deprecated.) -> [How to configure a Secure Context / https](#configuring-https)

## Installation

1. Install [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/blob/v2025.628.4510/docs/getting_started.md)

2. Download the [compressed archive](https://github.com/MrCreativ3001/moonlight-web-stream/releases/latest) for your platform and uncompress it or [build it yourself](#building)

3. Run the "web-server" executable

4. Change your [access credentials](#credentials) in the newly generated `server/config.json` (all changes require a restart)

5. Go to `localhost:8080` and view the web interface. You can also the change [bind address](#bind-address).

### Unraid

1. Copy `docker/unraid-template.xml` to `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` on your Unraid server (or use *Add Container ➜ Template ➜ Load* to browse to the file).
2. In the Docker tab select *Add Container*, choose the "moonlight-web-stream" template, and adjust the host port as needed.
3. Map `/mnt/user/appdata/moonlight-web-stream` (or another appdata path) to `/moonlight-web/server` to persist `config.json`, pairing data, and certificates.
4. The template exposes environment variables (for example `ML_WEB_BIND_IP`, `ML_WEB_PORT`, `ML_WEB_ICE_SERVER_URLS`, `ML_WEB_ICE_USERNAME`, `ML_WEB_ICE_CREDENTIAL`, `ML_WEB_NAT_IPS`) that translate directly into the Moonlight Web config so you can control bind address, TURN credentials, and NAT settings from the Unraid UI.
5. Forward the chosen TCP port and UDP range (default `8080` and `40000-40100/udp`) through your router or firewall if you intend to stream over the internet.

The repository ships a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and pushes a `linux/amd64` Docker image to Docker Hub once you configure the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets for your account. Trigger it by pushing to `master`, creating a tag that starts with `v`, or running the workflow manually from the Actions tab.

## Setup

Add your pc:

1. Add a new pc (<img src="moonlight-web/web-server/web/resources/ic_add_to_queue_white_48px.svg" alt="icon" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">) with the address as `localhost` and leave the port empty (if you've got the default port)

2. Pair your pc by clicking on the host (<img src="moonlight-web/web-server/web/resources/desktop_windows-48px.svg" alt="icon" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">) and entering the code in sunshine

3. Launch an app

### Streaming over the Internet

1. Set the [bind address](#bind-address) to the one of your network and forward the web server port (default is 8080, http is 80, https is 443)

```json
{
    "bind_address": "192.168.1.1:80"
}
```

When in a local network the WebRTC Peers will negotatiate without any problems.
When you want to play to over the Internet the STUN servers included by default will try to negotiate the peers directly.
This works for most of the networks, but if your network is very restrictive it might not work.
If this is the case try to configure one or both of these options:
1. The most reliable and recommended way is to use a [turn server](#configure-a-turn-server)
2. [Forward the ports directly](#port-forward) (this might not work if the firewall blocks udp)

#### Configure a turn server
1. Host and configure a turn server like [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) or use other services to host one for you.

2. Add your turn server to your WebRTC Ice Server list
```json
{
    "webrtc_ice_servers": [
        {
            "urls": [
                    "stun:l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun3.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun4.l.google.com:19302",
            ]
        },
        {
            "urls": [
                    "turn:yourip.com:3478?transport=udp",
                    "turn:yourip.com:3478?transport=tcp",
                    "turn:yourip.com:5349?transport=tcp"
            ],
            "username": "your username",
            "credential": "your credential"
        }
    ]
}
```
Some (business) firewalls might be very strict and only allow tcp on port 443 for turn connections if that's the case also bind the turn server on port 443 and add `"turn:yourip.com:443?transport=tcp"` to the url's list.

#### Port forward

1. Set the port range used by the WebRTC Peer to a fixed range in the [config](#config)
```json
{
    "webrtc_port_range": {
        "min": 40000,
        "max": 40010
    }
}
```
2. Forward the port range specified in the previous step as `udp`.
If you're using Windows Defender make sure to allow NAT Traversal. Important: If your firewall blocks udp connections this won't work and you need to host a [turn server](#configure-a-turn-server)

3. Configure [WebRTC Nat 1 To 1](#webrtc-nat-1-to-1-ips) to advertise your [public ip](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) (Optional: WebRTC stun servers can usually automatically detect them):
```json
{
    "webrtc_nat_1to1": {
        "ice_candidate_type": "host",
        "ips": [
            "74.125.224.72"
        ]
    }
}
```

It might be helpful to look what kind of nat your pc is behind:

### Configuring https
You can configure https directly with the Moonlight Web Server.

1. You'll need a private key and a certificate.

You can generate a self signed certificate with this python script [moonlight-web/web-server/generate_certificate.py](moonlight-web/web-server/generate_certificate.py):

```sh
pip install pyOpenSSL
python ./moonlight-web/web-server/generate_certificate.py
```

2. Copy the files `server/key.pem` and `server/cert.pem` into your `server` directory.

3. Modify the [config](#config) to enable https using the certificates
```json
{
    "certificate": {
        "private_key_pem": "./server/key.pem",
        "certificate_pem": "./server/cert.pem"
    }
}
```

### Proxying via Apache 2
It's possible to proxy the Moonlight Website using [Apache 2](https://httpd.apache.org/).

Note:
When you want to use https, the Moonlight Website should use http so that Apache 2 will handle all the https encryption.

1. Enable the modules `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_wstunnel`

```sh
sudo a2enmod mod_proxy mod_proxy_wstunnel
```

2. Create a new file under `/etc/apache2/conf-available/moonlight-web.conf` with the content:
```
# Example subpath "/moonlight" -> To connect you'd go to "http://yourip.com/moonlight/"
Define MOONLIGHT_SUBPATH /moonlight
# The address and port of your Moonlight Web server
Define MOONLIGHT_STREAMER YOUR_LOCAL_IP:YOUR_PORT

ProxyPreserveHost on
        
# Important: This WebSocket will help negotiate the WebRTC Peers
<Location ${MOONLIGHT_SUBPATH}/api/host/stream>
        ProxyPass ws://${MOONLIGHT_STREAMER}/api/host/stream
        ProxyPassReverse ws://${MOONLIGHT_STREAMER}/api/host/stream
</Location>

ProxyPass ${MOONLIGHT_SUBPATH}/ http://${MOONLIGHT_STREAMER}/
ProxyPassReverse ${MOONLIGHT_SUBPATH}/ http://${MOONLIGHT_STREAMER}/
```

3. Enable the created config file
```sh
sudo a2enconf moonlight-web
```

4. Change [config](#config) to include the [prefixed path](#web-path-prefix)
```json
{
    "web_path_prefix": "/moonlight"
}
```

5. Use https with a certificate (Optional)

## Config
The config file is under `server/config.json` relative to the executable.
Here are the most important settings for configuring Moonlight Web.

For a full list of values look into the [Rust Config module](moonlight-web/common/src/config.rs).

### Credentials
The credentials the Website will prompt you to enter.
Change this from the default value to the credentials for the website.

```json
{
    "credentials": "your password"
}
```

If you set this null authentication will be disabled and the `Authorization` header won't be used in requests.

```json
{
    "credentials": null
}
```

### Bind Address 
The address and port the website will run on

```json
{
    "bind_address": "127.0.0.1:8080"
}
```

### Https Certificates
If enabled the web server will use https with the provided certificate data

```json
{
    "certificate": {
        "private_key_pem": "./server/key.pem",
        "certificate_pem": "./server/cert.pem"
    }
}
```

### WebRTC Port Range
This will set the port range on the web server used to communicate when using WebRTC

```json
{
    "webrtc_port_range": {
        "min": 40000,
        "max": 40010
    }
}
```

### WebRTC Ice Servers
A list of ice servers for webrtc to use.

```json
{
    "webrtc_ice_servers": [
        {
            "urls": [
                    "stun:l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun3.l.google.com:19302",
                    "stun:stun4.l.google.com:19302",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### WebRTC Nat 1 to 1 ips
This will advertise the ip as an ice candidate on the web server.
It's recommended to set this but stun servers should figure out the public ip.

`ice_candidate_type`:
- `host` -> This is the ip address of the server and the client can connect to
- `srflx` -> This is the public ip address of this server, like an ice candidate added from a stun server.

```json
{
    "webrtc_nat_1to1": {
        "ice_candidate_type": "host",
        "ips": [
            "74.125.224.72"
        ]
    }
}
```

### WebRTC Network Types
This will set the network types allowed by webrtc.
<br>Allowed values:
- udp4: All udp with ipv4
- udp6: All udp with ipv6
- tcp4: All tcp with ipv4
- tcp6: All tcp with ipv6

```json
{
    "webrtc_network_types": [
        "udp4",
        "udp6",
    ]
}
```

### Web Path Prefix
This is useful when rerouting the web page using services like [Apache 2](#proxying-via-apache-2).
Will always append the prefix to all requests made by the website.

```json
{
    "web_path_prefix": "/moonlight"
}
```

## Contributors
- Thanks to [@Argon2000](https://github.com/Argon2000) for implementing a canvas renderer, which makes this run in the Tesla browser.

## Building
Make sure you've cloned this repo with all it's submodules
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MrCreativ3001/moonlight-web-stream.git
```
A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) [nightly](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html) installation is required.

There are 2 ways to build Moonlight Web:
- Build it on your system

  When you want to build it on your system take a look at how to compile the crates:
  - [moonlight common sys](#crate-moonlight-common-sys)
  - [moonlight web server](#crate-moonlight-web-server)
  - [moonlight web streamer](#crate-moonlight-web-streamer)

- Compile using [Cargo Cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)

  After you've got a successful installation of cross just run the command in the project root directory
  This will compile the [web server](#crate-moonlight-web-server) and the [streamer](#crate-moonlight-web-streamer)
  ```sh
  cross build --release --target YOUR_TARGET
  ```
  Note: windows only has the gnu target `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

### Crate: Moonlight Common Sys
[moonlight-common-sys](./moonlight-common-sys/) are rust bindings to the cpp [moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c) library.

Required for building:
- A [CMake installation](https://cmake.org/download/) which will automatically compile the [moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c) library
- [openssl-sys](https://docs.rs/openssl-sys/0.9.109/openssl_sys/): For information on building openssl sys go to the [openssl docs](https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/)
- A [bindgen installation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html) for generating the bindings to the [moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c) library

### Crate: Moonlight Web Server
This is the web server for Moonlight Web found at `moonlight-web/web-server/`.
It'll spawn a multiple [streamers](#crate-moonlight-web-server) as a subprocess for handling each stream.

Required for building:
- [moonlight-common-sys](#moonlight-common-sys)

Build the web frontend with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
The build output will be in `moonlight-web/web-server/dist`. The dist folder needs to be called `static` and in the same directory as the web server executable.

### Crate: Moonlight Web Streamer
This is the streamer subprocess of the [web server](#crate-moonlight-web-server) and found at `moonlight-web/streamer/`.
It'll communicate via stdin and stdout with the web server to negotiate the WebRTC peers and then continue to communicate via the peer.

Required for building:
- [moonlight-common-sys](#moonlight-common-sys)
